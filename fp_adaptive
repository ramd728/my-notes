Learning Rate (α): Determines how quickly the threshold θ adapts over time.

When is it used? During dynamic threshold adjustment:

θ_new = (1 − α) × θ_old + α × (μ_FP + k × σ_FP)

Where:

μ_FP and σ_FP are the mean and standard deviation of scores reclassified as false positives

k is a small constant (e.g., 1)

Real-world Example:

Initial threshold θ = 15

After validating multiple 10-device orders, μ_FP = 10 and σ_FP = 0.5

With α = 0.2, θ_new = (1 − 0.2) × 15 + 0.2 × (10 + 1 × 0.5) = 12.9

With α = 0.5, θ_new = (1 − 0.5) × 15 + 0.5 × (10 + 0.5) = 12.75

Interpretation:

A higher α reacts faster to behavior changes, reducing false positives sooner

A lower α resists abrupt shifts, ensuring stability when anomalies are rare
