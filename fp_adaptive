Learning Rate (α): Determines how quickly the threshold θ adapts over time.

When is it used? During dynamic threshold adjustment:

θ_new = (1 − α) × θ_old + α × (μ_FP + k × σ_FP)

Where:

μ_FP and σ_FP are the mean and standard deviation of scores reclassified as false positives

k is a small constant (e.g., 1)

Real-world Example:

Initial threshold θ = 15

After validating multiple 10-device orders, μ_FP = 10 and σ_FP = 0.5

With α = 0.2, θ_new = (1 − 0.2) × 15 + 0.2 × (10 + 1 × 0.5) = 12.9

With α = 0.5, θ_new = (1 − 0.5) × 15 + 0.5 × (10 + 0.5) = 12.75

Interpretation:

A higher α reacts faster to behavior changes, reducing false positives sooner

A lower α resists abrupt shifts, ensuring stability when anomalies are rare




Great observation — let’s clarify why Score = 13 is marked as “Valid (Reclassified FP)” even when θ_new = 12.75 (i.e., 13 > θ_new):

✅ What’s Actually Happening:
The algorithm uses two mechanisms to determine whether to reclassify a previously flagged score like 13:

1. Threshold (θ) Check:
The initial classification is based on the threshold.

If Score > θ, it's flagged as an anomaly.

2. Confidence-Based Reclassification:
Even if the score exceeds θ or θ_new, it can still be reclassified as valid if:

Its deviation from the valid window mean (μ_V) is within the tolerance band:

∣ai−μV∣≤τ⋅σ V
​
It consistently appears in the stream and builds up a high confidence score (C_j).

💡 So, for ID 6, Score = 13:
It was initially flagged because it exceeded θ = 15.

Over time:

Its confidence score increased as similar values like 13, 14, 15 continued to appear.

It likely fell within the tolerance band as μ_V increased and σ_V adjusted.

Thus, it was reclassified as valid, even though it’s slightly above the new θ = 12.75.

🔁 Summary:
Threshold (θ_new) helps prevent many false positives, but it is not the only factor.

Confidence score and tolerance band proximity enable the model to reclassify values like 13 as valid — even if marginally over θ_new.
